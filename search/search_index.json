Let's start by pulling down the GitHub repository with the source code. GitHub git clone https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout cd scout pip install --requirement requirements.txt --editable . Pip To get the latest version, use the above. When using pip the latest stable release will be installed. pip install scout-browser 2. Setup Full setup To initialize a working instance with all genes, diseases etc run scout setup database for more info, run scout --help If you intent to use authentication, make sure you are using a Google email! The previous command setup the database with a curated collection of gene definitions with links to OMIM along with HPO phenotype terms. Now we will load some example data.

One could imagine that in the future, some or all annotations could be performed by Scout. For now scout will look for some known keys when uploading a VCF and extract information for those. VEP is the tool supported for functional and regional annotations at the moment, SnpEff will be added in the near future. For the other types of annotations Scout will look for certain keys in the INFO field of the vcf and expect the value to be of a specific type. This means that there is not a dependency on any other specific annotation tool besides VEP, just make sure that the key and values are correct according to the specification below. Rank score One of the hard problem when dealing with whole genome data is the huge amount variants that are generated in every analysis. Scout was developed to be used in rare variant analysis, this means that there is ony a small number of variants that are actually interesting to look at. We do not want to store all variants from each case in a database that should be able to controll thousands of cases. To solve this problem we are working with rank scores, each variant is scored according to a scoring schema then we only upload and sort the variants based on their rank score. In this way the users can start by looking at the variants that looks potentially most dangerous from a bioinformatic perspective. We use the tool genmod to (among other things) score the variant, but as long as there is a RankScore -field in the INFO field of the VCF with a float as value it is handeled by Scout. Annotation keys and tool suggestions In this section all the different annotation keys and suggestions of tools that can be used to annotate them are listed.

To do so it is necessary to install the python package Chanjo and its report visualization app, chanjo-report . Both these programs require a database to store samples names, transcript specifications and statistics relative to the trascript coverage for all samples. Note that chanjo can be used as a standalone but chanjo-report needs to have access to the data produced by chanjo to generate coverage reports. Scout does not require chanjo installed in the path to visualize coverage reports, but it is necessary to install chanjo-report and set up the connection to a database containing coverage data in order to use this fuctionality . Chanjo database Chanjo-report (and chanjo) work with MySQL and SQLite databases. This guide explains how to set up a MySQL database since this database is the one used in production at Clinical Genomics. For a guide on how to install MySQL on your server click here . Once the database and the administrator user and password are configured, you can create the new database to contain the chanjo structures. To do so, from a terminal type: mysql -u admin_user -padmin_password #no space between -p and password mysql> create database chanjo4_demo; mysql> exit To create a new empty database download the empty schema chanjo4_structure.sql under scout/demo/resources . The command to restore the database from this dump file is: mysql -u admin_user -padmin_password chanjo4_demo < path/to/chanjo4_structure.sql #no space between -p and password To create instead a demo database containing coverage data for genes in panel1 for the samples used in the demo version of scout, you might download the schema chanjo4_demo.sql .

Posted: 27 April 2017 This updates contains many bug fixes and a few new features. New feature: cohort tag We have introduced \"cohort tags\", where you can tag each case as belonging to one or several cohorts. Future release of Scout will include functionality to get statistics on selected cohorts or all cases. For instance, you will be able to get statistics on the number of samples within a cohort, how many are cases solved and which genes there were causative variants in. Or perhaps you want to know which phenotype terms are associated with a particular cohort. For now, the cohort tags are specific to CMMS, but we urge all user to supply to us their own set of tags to be used within the corresponding Scout instance. This applies to phenotype groups as well as we think this will be very useful in future to describe your cohorts clinically. New feature: pip distribution Scout is now installable via pip ! This means installing the server and CLI is as simple as running: pip install scout-browser Everything to setup the server; genes, HPO terms, OMIM information, etc. is included in the distribution. Bug fixes Compounds are now sorted on combined score The delivery report opens in a new tab A link from the variant page to the gene panel exists Cases are properly activated when variants are first viewed Fixed display of HGVS description Fixed issues with Sanger email Support for a new analysis type: TGA, Targeted Genome Analysis Fixed issue with filtering on 1000G frequency","title":"Whats new in 3.1?"},{"location":"blog/new-3.1/#whats-new-in-31","text":"Posted: 27 April 2017 This updates contains many bug fixes and a few new features.","title":"What's new in 3.1?"},{"location":"blog/new-3.1/#new-feature-cohort-tag","text":"We have introduced \"cohort tags\", where you can tag each case as belonging to one or several cohorts.

It will take you first to a page where you fill in evidence which Scout uses to calculate a classification - you can, however, override this later! We store a history of all classifications for a variant if it's updated later. Please try it out and get back to us with your feedback! New users view We've added a new views for displaying all users of Scout. You can see name, email, and which institutes they belong to if you need to contact someone. We also introduced a \"rank\" based on how much you interact with Scout! Check out how you are doing here: Scout Users . More new features: Cases are now listed by status in separate groups - only the latest 100 cases are listed! Upload of gene panel export Dynamic gene panel is back! You can now upload a list of HGNC symbols to do a temporary search Scout will now display exon as well as intron number in the Sanger email You can now filter variants on local observations in the SNV view and they will show up in the popup Scout will now display if a variant is in the PAR region or not You can now update the default gene panels directly in Scout - no need to rerun!

Note: Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, and so on, can contribute to nonmaternity. PS3 Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. Note: Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well established. PS4 The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence in controls. Note 1: Relative risk or OR, as obtained from case\u2013control studies, is >5.0, and the confidence interval around the estimate of relative risk or OR does not include 1.0. See the article for detailed guidance. Note 2: In instances of very rare variants where case\u2013control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence. Moderate PM1 Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g., active site of an enzyme) without benign variation. PM2 Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) (Table 6) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium Caveat: Population data for insertions/deletions may be poorly called by next-generation sequencing. PM3 For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant Note: This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase. PM4 Protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletions/insertions in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants. PM5 Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before. Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level. PM6 Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity Supporting PP1 Cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease. Note: May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data PP2 Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and in which missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. PP3 Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.). Caveat: Because many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant. PP4 Patient\u2019s phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology. PP5 Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation. Evidence of benign impact Stand-alone BA1 Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium. Strong BS1 Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder (see Table 6) BS2 Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age. BS3 Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing. BS4 Lack of segregation in affected members of a family Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e., cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation. Supporting BP1 Missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease. BP2 Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern. BP3 In-frame deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function. BP4 Multiple lines of computational evidence suggest no impact on gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.). Caveat: Because many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm cannot be counted as an independent criterion. BP4 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant. BP5 Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease. BP6 Reputable source recently reports variant as benign, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation. BP7 A synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved.","title":"ACMG"},{"location":"user-guide/acmg-criterias/#evidence-of-pathogenecity","text":"","title":"Evidence of pathogenecity"},{"location":"user-guide/acmg-criterias/#very-strong","text":"","title":"Very Strong"},{"location":"user-guide/acmg-criterias/#pvs1","text":"Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical \u00b11 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multiexon deletion) in a gene where LOF is a known mechanism of disease Caveats: Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g., GFAP, MYH7) Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3\u2032 end of a gene Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts","title":"PVS1"},{"location":"user-guide/acmg-criterias/#strong","text":"","title":"Strong"},{"location":"user-guide/acmg-criterias/#ps1","text":"Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change Example: Val\u2192Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level","title":"PS1"},{"location":"user-guide/acmg-criterias/#ps2","text":"De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.

Sometimes you will also see a cyan colored dot to the left of the case ID. This is an indicator that there's been some recent activity in the case such as a new comment. Your name will be tagged for each case that is assigned to you. For cases that are assigned to other people you will see a tag \"ASSIGNED\". In the search field you can enter search terms to limit the list displayed. Entering a user name shows only cases assigned to that user. A case- or sample id will return only cases with matches to those ids. A search starting with \"HP:\", e.g. \"HP:0002664\" will return cases with exactly matching HPO phenotype terms . A search starting with \"synopsis:\", e.g. \"synopsis:epilepsy\" will return cases with free text matches to the string following \"synopsis:\". Case This is the detailed view of one individual case. The intended use is to give a concise overview of the family under investigation and show recent activity related to the case. Case report page It can be visualized by clicking on the 'Visualize report' link on the left sidebar present on the case view. The case report contains a phenotype info panel as well as an overview of the gene panels used for the analysis. This page is showing also any variant users have been interacting with when working with the case: causative variants, variants pinned as candidates, ACMG or otherwise manually classified variants, as well as variants with any comment field. At the bottom of the report page the 'Dismissed variants' panel lists all variants that have been dismissed, with the reason(s) why they were rejected as candidates. By clicking on the top right button the case report can be exported and saved into a PDF file. Pinned variants There's a list of \"Strong candidates\" on the page. This list is curated by the collaborators and consists of \"pinned\" variants from the variants list. This feature can be used to mark variants of particular interest that you might want to highlight to other users. Pinned variants for cases with at least one assigned HPO phenotype can be used to produce Clinvar submission files (See more under \"Variant\"). Misc. The case page also displays a simple wiki-style synopsis on the current case that can be used to communicate information on the case to collaborators. Rank model version shows which rank model that has been used to rank the variants in the case The \"Activity\" feed is a reverse chronological list of events and comments related to the case. Examples of events include comments, status updates, assignments, Sanger sequencing orders etc. Actions There are a few actions you can take on this page. Adopt case : By clicking the button next to \"Adopt\" you can assign yourself to a case. More than one person can be assigned to a case, e.g. if multiple professions or institutes are involved in analysis. If you have assigned yourself to a case you can click your name to \"unassign\". The case can be moved to \"Research\" which means all variants will be made visible for the entire exome. Clicking \"Open research\" will notify the administrators of the site. The user agrees that she is reponsible to have acquired an informed consent relevant for this action. This will also be logged as a new event in the case log. Edit case synopsis : The case sysnopsis can be edited in a format known as [Markdown][markdown]. Just click \"EDIT\" to open the editor view. When you are finished click \"SAVE\" to save changes or \"CANCEL\" to abort. Comment : You can leave comments in the activity log by writing a message in the input box next to the feed. Click \"COMMENT\" to submit the comment. MatchMaker Exchange integration Starting with release 4.4, Scout offers integration for patient data sharing via MatchMaker Exchange. General info about MatchMaker and patient matching could be found in this paper . Authorized users (contact Scout admins if you wish to start sharing cases using this network!) will have access to a MatchMaker submission form present on the case page: Requisites to share patient data using MatchMaker (MME): There must be at least one HPO term specified at the case level AND/OR one pinned variant . A maximum number of 3 variants can be exported to MatchMaker Exchange for a case. Submitting users are willing to be contacted (via email) by users from external MatchMaker nodes in case of positive patient matching. MatchMaker Exchange network discourages the submission of variants which are already known to case a certain phenotype and welcomes instead the submission of novel or unknown but strongly suspected variants for the condition . Patient sharing options Including patient gender is optional Including an HPO term is required if there is no pinned variant at the case level Including OMIM diagnosis is not mandatory, but could be of help to the matching algorithm when looking for similar patients on MME. Submitting users can decide to share specific variant data (chromosome, position, specific change, zygosity) or only gene name . Providing complete information will of course improve matching power. Submitted patients can be modified or removed from MatchMaker any time from the Scout case page. From the same interface, by clicking on 'match against', users will be able to run matches against Scout patients already submitted to MatchMaker or patients present in connected external nodes: By clicking on 'Matches', users can review the submitted data for a case ( Patient Overview tab) and all positive match results for a case against patients from external nodes ( External Matches ) or other Scout patients in MatchMaker server ( Internal Matches ): Matches will be ordered by date and each single match object will display matching patients by score, from the highest (most similar to the case) to the lowest(least similar to the case).","title":"Cases"},{"location":"user-guide/cases/#cases","text":"This page displays the list of active cases for a particular institute.

General Scout is developed to be used in a clinical setting and therefore gene panels is a central concept. The gene panels describes a set of genes with additional information that is often associated with a disease or a disease group. A case can then be associated with one or several gene panels. File format The gene panel is a tab separated text file with a header that describes the columns and one line for each gene entry. The columns that will be used by scout is the following: hgnc_id(int) This identifies the gene. Mandatory hgnc_symbol(str) This is used for sanity check when humans look at the file. Optional disease_associated_transcripts(str) ','-separated list of manually curated transcripts. Optional genetic_disease_models(str) ','-separated list of manually curated inheritance patterns that are followed for a gene. Optional mosaicism(str) If a gene is known to be associated with mosaicism this is annotated. Optional reduced_penetrance(str) If a gene is known to have reduced penetrance this is annotated. Optional database_entry_version(str) The database entry version is a way to track when a a gene was added or modified. Optional Each gene in a gene panel have to be identified with a hgnc id File format 2 There is also an option to include all information about a panel in the header of the file. This could make uploading easier, just a matter of taste. In this case include a header with metadata, each of these lines are key-value separated by = .

A variant can be pinned by anyone and likewise unpinned by anyone (not just the person who originally pinned it). The activity log will store records of who did what for future reference, however. Mark Causative A variant is marked causative when it is confirmed to be disease causing in a case. The variant will show up on the case page as causative variant. A case can have multiple causative variants. When a variant is marked causative, Scout will remember the variant so when when entering a new case Scout will indicate if a variant that was previously marked causative within the same institute exists in the particular case. Dismissing a variant Conversely, often it is possible to judge a variant highly unlikely to cause the patients phenotype, for one of many reasons. Perhaps it is too common locally, is of LoF type in a gene where only GoF mutation has been described in disease, lacks genotype-phenotype correlation in the case of broad panels or has no obvious conceptual impact on the protein generated. The user can choose one or more reasons to dismiss the variant. Dismissed variants are grayed out on variants display, and shown as dismissed in the case report.

Variants are added to the database in the following way: For each case we pick one affected individual Variants are filtered out based on if they are common or have a very low call quality The remaining variants are stored in loqusdb Each time the user looks at a variant scout will ask locusdb how many times it has been seen across all cases from all institutes (obs.), how many times it has been seen in a homozygous state (homo.) and how many cases these numbers are based on (tot.).","title":"Local Frequency Database"},{"location":"user-guide/variants/","text":"Variants The big list of variants. This page serves as an overview of all data and annotations for a single case. It's meant to allow you to skim through many variants ordered by the ranking. The first couple of columns are meant to give you a sense of place in the overall ranked list. The \"Rank\" column is especially useful after applying various filters. Hovering over both \"1000 Genomes\" (frequency) and \"CADD score\" (severity) columns will reveal additional metrics in a popup. Hovering over \"Inheritance models\" will pop up a list of all possible compounds if the variants follows this pattern. At the bottom of the list you will find a button to load the next batch of variants in the list. To return to the previous batch of variants, just press the browser back button. It's also possible to filter the variants using a number of different criteria. Open the filters panel by clicking the \"filter\" icon in the top right. Here you can fill in form and click \"Filter variants\" to update the list. This is also the place where you switch gene lists. Variant This is the most complex view with a lot of related data presented to the user in a compact way. A lot of thought went into the design of the layout so here it the imagined workflow. Toolbar Two options are added to the right side of the menu: Send Sanger email to an institute related email address. Pin the current variant as interesting so that it shows up in the case view. Mark variant as causative. This is only to be used when a variant is confirmed to be causative - it will set the case to \"solved\" automatically. Fixed header Introduces the basic facts of the variant that the user is often referring back to. As an example you need to refer back to the chromosome when assessing possible inheritance models. Summary This is the first a user looks at when assesing the variant. Rank score/CADD score Disease gene model, possible inheritance models, OMIM model Frequencies CLINSIG number SV frequency - SVDB Structural variant database freqency is annotated with [SVDB](https://github.com/J35P312/SVDB), using a clustering algorithm [DBSCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN). Variant type and chromosome are exact, but start and end positions for matches are approximate, and depend on previous cases from the database. In a region with multiple, inexactly positioned events, matching will be more relaxed than if only tightly clustered variants with near similar start and end coordinates have been found. Databases include research cases from Clinical genetics (WGS at NGI), clinical cases with arrayCGH (benign or pathogenic collections), Decipher, SweGen and local cases. Details see Annotations Functional Annotation This is the worst functional impact of all transcripts Clinvar submission of pinned variants Single nucleotide variants, indels, insertions, as well as larger structural variants can be used to create submissions to Clinvar , a free public database of phenotype-genotype associations. One of more pinned variants for a case with assigned phenotype might be used from the Clinvar submission page to create comma separated file to be used in the submission process. The Scout submission form mirrors the fields on the Clinvar submission spreadsheets. Optional case data for one or more pinned variants can also be generated and uploaded together with the variants during the file submission. Prior registration of a user and a submitting organization to the Clinvar portal is required to submit data to the Clinvar database. Region Annotation This is the region of the most severe functional impact GT Call Variant Callers Badges below the GT Call table show the variant caller responsible for the calls and their filter status. A variant with Pass status passed all the filters from its variant callers, whereas a Filtered call was detected by the caller but not deemed passing filter quality. SNVs and indels GATK FreeBayes SAMtools SVs SVs are structural variants, balanced or unbalanced chromosomal abberrations. Size filtering can be done either to show only variants longer than the given size, or shorter if the \"Length shorter than\" checkbox is activated. When the checkbox is ticked, queries are also inclusive of non-existing annotations e.g. SV events without size. Note that some BNDs, like interchromosomal translocations are given with a very large (larger than chromosome) size instead. Scout supports viewing general SVs as encoded in the VCF format specification. Some sample callers that we have worked with include: TIDDIT TIDDIT Locally developed structural variant caller that uses discordant read pair detection and supplementary alignments for split reads from the bam file to call structural variations, including deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations (BND). The number of supporting links is used to call the reliability of the call. Read depth information is used to infer the variant type as well as zygosity where possible. Delivers exact breakpoints when possible. Sensitivity for clinically relevant deletions is 100%, balanced events lower but at a best-in-class >80%. Be advised to consider zygosity calls from balanced events as highly uncertain.

Infers deletions and duplications from binning read depth. Will call inexact boundaries for the events. Effectively 100% sensitivity for large CNVs in accessible regions. Be wary if CNVnator did not call your large unbalanced variant - that may indicate a false positive. Comparatively decent zygosity-calls from v0.3.3. Abyzov A, Urban AE, Snyder M, Gerstein M.

Manta Manta : Internationally well used de-facto standard for structural variant calling. Uses discordant read pairs and split read graphs to call variants.
